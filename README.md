## Project 1: Analyzing the Relationship Between SAT Scores and College Acceptance Rates

### Summary
>1.	SAT results vary widely in California. Some counties are underperforming.
>2.	Failing to meet SAT benchmarks is an obstacle for a student’s college admission.
>3.	School-based SAT prep courses could be a solution for counties with below-average SAT results.

### Overview
- Part 1: Plot the percentage of students meeting both SAT benchmarks grouped by county.
    * The purpose of this goal is to establish the setting. Are there counties in California that have low SAT results? Which counties need the most help and which are overperforming?
- Part 2: Measure the importance of SAT Scores. Analyze the relationship between college acceptance rates and the SAT scores of accepted students.
  * The purpose of Goal 2 is to investigate why low SAT scores are a problem for students. 
  * The analysis investigates why it is worth investing in a solution for low SAT scores.
  * In Goal 2 we focus on the relationship between college acceptance rates and the 25th percentile of accepted students’ SAT scores.
  * The analysis indicates that exceeding an SAT score of 1010 is an important hurdle for students. Once students clear that hurdle they exceed the 25th percentile of accepted students at many colleges.
- Part 3: Discuss school-based SAT prep courses as a possible solution for counties with below-average SAT results.
  * Goal 3 relies on *The Effect of an SAT Prep Course on SAT Scores at a Low Income Urban School*, a research paper by Jane L. Dulin of Goucher College
  * The study discussed in Dulin’s paper compares SAT scores between 62 students who took a semester-long SAT prep course (the intervention group) and 217 students who did not take the course (the non-intervention group)
  * The results:
    * The intervention group outperformed the non-intervention group by 117 points.
    * With a p value < .0001, Dulin rejected the null hypothesis that there would be no difference between the scores of the intervention group and the non-intervention group
